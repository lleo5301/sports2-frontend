# Sports2 Frontend Build Specification

> Spec for designers and developers building the Sports2 collegiate baseball scouting and team management web application. Use this document alongside the API reference when implementing the frontend.

---

## 1. Project Context

### What is Sports2?

Sports2 is a **multi-tenant** web platform for collegiate baseball programs. Each team (school) has its own isolated data: players, prospects, schedules, depth charts, scouting reports, and more. The primary users are coaches, assistant coaches, and staff managing roster, recruiting, and daily operations.

### Key Concepts

| Concept | Description | Design Implication |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Team** | The central tenant. A college program (e.g., Miami Dade). Most data belongs to a team. | Show team branding (logo, colors). User always operates in one team context. |
| **Player** | Someone on the roster. Has game stats, depth chart placement. | "Roster" / "Players" section. Used for lineup, stats, depth chart. |
| **Prospect** | Someone being recruited (HS, JUCO, transfer). Not yet on roster. | "Recruiting" / "Prospects" section. Has scouting reports, media, pipeline status. |
| **Scouting Report** | Evaluation of a player or prospect with grades. Uses 20-80 scale or letters. | Forms with present/future grades. Display respects team's grade scale setting. |
| **Preference List** | Grouping of prospects/players by recruiting category (e.g., HS pref list, pitchers). | Kanban or list views by list type. |

### Core Distinction: Prospect vs Player

Designers and developers must distinguish these clearly in the UI:

- **Prospect** → Recruiting pipeline, scouting reports, media, preference lists. No game stats. No depth chart.
- **Player** → Roster, game statistics, depth chart. Can also have scouting reports and preference lists (e.g., transfer portal).

---

## 2. Reference Documents

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **`openapi.yaml`** (root) | Full API spec. Use for client generation, endpoint reference, request/response schemas. |
| **`docs/api/scouting-system-api.md`** | Scouting system details: prospects, 20-80 grades, recruiting pipeline, media, preference lists. |

---

## 3. User Roles & Permissions

### Roles

| Role | Access |
|------|--------|
| **super_admin** | Full access including user management, admin endpoints. |
| **head_coach** | Full access to team features, branding. Cannot manage other super_admins. |
| **assistant_coach** | Players, schedules, reports. May lack permission for depth chart, schedule edit, team settings. |

### Permissions (Granular)

Not all users see or can do everything. Permissions are granted per-user and include:

- `depth_chart_view`, `depth_chart_create`, `depth_chart_edit`, `depth_chart_delete`
- `schedule_view`, `schedule_create`, `schedule_edit`, `schedule_delete`
- `reports_view`, `reports_create`, `reports_edit`, `reports_delete`
- `team_settings`, `user_management`
- `player_assign`, `player_unassign`

**Design/Dev**: Hide or disable UI for actions the user lacks permission for. Use `GET /api/v1/auth/permissions` to drive this.

---

## 4. Authentication Flow

### Required Headers

All authenticated requests need:

1. **`Authorization: Bearer <JWT>`** — From login/register.
2. **`x-csrf-token`** — Required for POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE. Fetch before first state-changing request.

### Flow

```
1. User visits app
2. If not logged in → redirect to Login
3. On Login:
   - POST /api/v1/auth/login { email, password }
   - Store JWT (cookie or secure storage)
4. Before any mutation:
   - GET /api/v1/auth/csrf-token
   - Store token, send as x-csrf-token header on POST/PUT/DELETE
5. On 401 → redirect to Login, clear storage
```

### Public Endpoints (No Auth)

- `GET /api/v1/auth/csrf-token`
- `POST /api/v1/auth/login`
- `POST /api/v1/auth/register`
- `GET /api/v1/teams` (for team selection during registration)

---

## 5. API Response Format

All API responses follow:

- **Success:** `{ "success": true, "data": { ... } }` or `{ "success": true, "data": [ ... ] }`
- **Pagination:** `{ "success": true, "data": [...], "pagination": { "page": 1, "limit": 20, "total": 47, "pages": 3 } }`
- **Error:** `{ "success": false, "error": "Description of what went wrong" }`
- **Validation:** May include `details` array with field-level errors.

Always check `success` before using `data`.

## 7. Design Guidelines

### Branding

- **Team logo:** From `GET /api/v1/teams/branding` → `logo_url`
- **Primary/secondary colors:** `primary_color`, `secondary_color` (hex). Defaults if null: `#3B82F6`, `#EF4444`
- Apply team branding to header, accent elements, buttons. Avoid hardcoding colors when team-specific.

### Multi-Tenant

- All data is scoped to the user's team. No cross-team views.
- Team context should be visible (e.g., team name in header).

### Accessibility

- Form labels, error messages, focus states.
- Tables with proper headers for screen readers.
- Sufficient color contrast.

### Forms

- Show validation errors inline. API returns `details` with field paths.
- Password: 8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, digit, special char. Show requirements on register/change-password.
- Optional fields: Allow empty; backend treats `""` as null where appropriate.

### Pagination

- API uses `page`, `limit` (default 20, max 100). Response includes `pagination: { page, limit, total, pages }`.
- Implement page controls or infinite scroll.

## 8. Technical Notes for Developers

### API Base URL

- Configure via environment. Default for local dev: `http://localhost:5000`
- OpenAPI spec uses localhost as reference only. Each deployment has its own base URL.

### Client Generation

```bash
# Example: Generate TypeScript client from OpenAPI
npx @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate -i openapi.yaml -g typescript-fetch -o ./src/api-client
```

### File Uploads

- **Player video:** `multipart/form-data` on `POST /api/v1/players`
- **Prospect media:** `POST /api/v1/prospects/{id}/media` — file (multipart) or URL (JSON)
- **Team logo:** `multipart/form-data` on `POST /api/v1/teams/logo`
- **Profile picture:** `multipart/form-data` on `PUT /api/v1/settings/profile-picture`

### CORS

- Backend allows origins from `CORS_ORIGIN` env. Ensure frontend origin is included.

### Error Handling

- 400: Validation — show `error` and `details`
- 401: Unauthenticated — redirect to login
- 403: Forbidden — show message, hide/disable action
- 404: Not found — show not-found state
- 500: Server error — generic message, optionally retry
