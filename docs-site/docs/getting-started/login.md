# Logging In

This guide covers how to sign in to Sports2 and what to expect from your session.

---

## Sign In

1. Go to your Sports2 URL (e.g. `app.sports2.com` or your school’s custom domain).
2. Enter your **email** and **password**.
3. Click **Sign In** (or **Log In**).

If your credentials are correct, you’ll be redirected to your dashboard. If not, check that caps lock is off and that you’re using the same email you registered with.

---

## First-Time Access

If you were invited to a team:

- Use the email address that received the invite.
- If you haven’t set a password yet, use the **Forgot password** link to create one, or use the link in the invite email if one was provided.
- Contact your administrator if you don’t have an account or invite.

## Staying Signed In

Sports2 keeps you signed in using a secure session. You stay logged in until you:

- Sign out manually (user menu → Sign out).
- Clear cookies or browser data.
- Hit a long period of inactivity (depends on your org’s settings).
- Use a different device or browser where you aren’t logged in.

For shared or public computers, always sign out when you’re done.

## Signing Out

1. Click your **profile/avatar** in the top-right.
2. Choose **Sign out** (or **Log out**).
3. You’ll return to the login screen.
