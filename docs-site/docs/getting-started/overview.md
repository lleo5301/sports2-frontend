# What is Sports2?

Sports2 is a **multi-tenant web platform** for collegiate baseball programs. Each team (school) has its own isolated data: players, prospects, schedules, depth charts, scouting reports, and more. Coaches, assistant coaches, and staff use Sports2 to manage roster, recruiting, and daily operations in one place.

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Team** | The central tenant—your college program. Most data belongs to a team. You always work within one team context. |
| **Player** | Someone on your roster. Has game stats, depth chart placement, and can appear in lineups. |
| **Prospect** | Someone you're recruiting (HS, JUCO, transfer). Not yet on roster. Has scouting reports, media, and pipeline status. |
| **Scouting Report** | Evaluation of a player or prospect with grades. Uses your team's grade scale (20–80 or letter grades). |
| **Preference List** | Grouping of prospects or players by recruiting category (e.g., HS pref list, pitchers). |

### Players vs Prospects

- **Prospect** → Recruiting pipeline, scouting reports, media, preference lists. No game stats. No depth chart.
- **Player** → Roster, game statistics, depth chart. Can also have scouting reports (e.g., transfer portal eval).
