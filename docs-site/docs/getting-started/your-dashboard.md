# Your Dashboard

The dashboard is your main entry point in Sports2. It gives you an overview of your team and quick access to common actions.

## What You’ll See

### Team Branding

At the top you’ll see your team’s logo and name. Team branding (colors, logos) is set by your head coach in Team Settings.

### Overview Stats

The dashboard shows at-a-glance numbers such as:

- **Players** — Count of roster players.
- **Prospects** — Count of prospects in the recruiting pipeline.
- **Schedules** — Upcoming schedules or events.
- **Wins / Losses** — Season record (when available).

These metrics help you see how your roster, recruiting, and record are shaping up.

### Recent & Upcoming Events

- **Recent** — Recently played games or completed events.
- **Upcoming** — Next scheduled games or events.

Use these to jump into a specific game or schedule.
