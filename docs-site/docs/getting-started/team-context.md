# Team Context

In Sports2, **team** is the central unit. All players, prospects, schedules, and reports belong to a team. You always work within one team at a time.

---

## One Team at a Time

- When you log in, you’re working in the context of **your team**.
- Data (roster, prospects, schedules, etc.) is scoped to the active team.
- If your account has access to multiple teams, you can switch between them.

---

## Switching Teams

If you have access to more than one team:

1. Open the **team selector** (usually in the sidebar or top bar).
2. Click the team you want to work with.
3. The app reloads data for that team. Players, prospects, schedules, and reports will reflect the selected team.

---

## Team Branding

Each team can have its own:

- **Logo** — Shown in the dashboard, sidebar, and other team-specific views.
- **Colors** — Used for accents and theming in the app.

Branding is configured by the head coach or administrator under **Team Settings**.

---

## Data Isolation

- **Players**, **prospects**, **schedules**, **depth charts**, and **scouting reports** are stored per team.
- Switching teams does not mix data. You only see and edit data for the team you’ve selected.
